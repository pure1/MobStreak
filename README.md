== **Mob Streak** ==
Mob Streak keeps count of how many mobs a player has killed, when the player reaches a set number of kills the server runs a command, this command is set in the configuration as is the number of kills to be reached. Multiple "steps" of commands can be set so if a player reaches a multiple of the set number of kills, the next command is run. It also tells you your streak on each kill (this is toggleable in the config).
